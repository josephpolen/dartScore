# dartScore
A dart scoring program that I'm working on in my freetime.

NOTE If you are running a linux machine such as Ubuntu the jar file will probably be blocked from running. To circumvent this enter this command in the directory where dartScore.jar is located in terminal, or command prompt in Windows

java -jar dartScore.jar

During my freshman year in college I made a very simple dart scoring application as a course project. Recently I decided to rewrite that project and make it more usuable and functional than I had before. This is a project I am working on in my freetime because I love to play darts and I wanted a dart scoring application that would score the games that I wanted to play. This is a work in progress and is updated often. Feel free to download the source code and take a look. If you dont want to bother with the source I have uploaded the compiled jar file that you can download and run as long as you have the Java Runtime installed on your machine.
